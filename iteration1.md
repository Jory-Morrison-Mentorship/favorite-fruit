# Iteration 1 Review

## Code Self Evaluation
1. Do you have a functioning program? 
2. Does your program handle any quantity of fruit?
3. What happens when the user selects a favorite that isn't one of two choices presented to him or her? Does your program do "input validation"?
4. Does your program know when to stop iterating over our fruit list?

## Food for Thought (Iteration 2)
5. What could we do to simplify the code with the use of function definitions?
6. What improvements can be made to the favorite fruit program?
